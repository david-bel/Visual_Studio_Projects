borem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
industry. borem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever
since the 1500s, when an unknown printer tnice a galley of type and
scrambled it to make a type specimen bnice. It has survived not only
five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
the release of Letraset sheets containing borem Ipsum passages, and
more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
including versions of borem Ipsum.
